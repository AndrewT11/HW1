# Horiseon Refactor Webpage Project

## A short exercise to clean up html elements and css styling for the Horiseon Webpage

**Refactoring** The purpose of this homework assignment was to refactor existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible

Important fo this project was making the website as acessible as possible, given our knowledge. Accessiblity would include video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

For this project, I used alt tags in my elements to add accessiblity. This would give people using audio to read a webpage to understand the pictures represented on the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

Achieved:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Lessons Learned
I learned many things through this project. One instance of this was working with the href links. I learned you cannot use class tags for links. You must use ID tags to have <a> work correctly. 

I was also under the impression that you could name HTML elements whatever you'd like, as long as it made sense. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

I was able to more quickly decipher between parent and children containers through this practice.
